# VirtInfra

VirtInfra is a solution to provision dummy infrastructure for your tests and trainings. It is the perfect 
companion of your documentation and blog posts. It avoids any reliance on a specific Cloud vendor. It removes the implication of a newbie errors like significant costs or very unsecure systems.

Its main use for now is in conjunction with the [Terraform provider for Virtinfra](https://github.com/ploumpouloum/terraform-provider-virtinfra), available on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ploumpouloum/virtinfra).
